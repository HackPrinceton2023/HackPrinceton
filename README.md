ReadMe for HackPrinceton 2023 project repository
Generate an GPT-3 API from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
replace 3rd line in path *HackPrinceton/backend/gpt3/gpt3.py/* with your API

Steps to run the Flask app:
1) Navigate to the backend file, `cd backend/`
2) For MacOS/Unix, please create a virtual environment by running `python3 -m venv env`. For windows, please run `py -m venv env`
3) Please install all the requirements listed in the requirements file by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` command
4) Then, run `python index.py` to run the Flask App

For step 2 above, here are some additional instructions if you don't have virtualenv installed: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/

Steps to run the React app:
1) Navigate to the frontend file, `cd frontend/`
2) `npm install`
2) `npm install vite`
3) `npm run dev` to run the frontend  



Citations:
For this Python Flask app, we mainly utilized Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript (React). We specifically used various different  Python pretrained models from open source HuggingFace website. Please find below the citations for the pretrained models we used from HuggingFace and OpenAI. Additionally, we also worked with libraries like OpenCV (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/4.7.0), pytesseract, langdetect, and googletrans.
